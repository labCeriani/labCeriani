## About Us

At the Laboratory of Behavior Genetics, we are dedicated to understanding how the brain's internal clocks communicate with each other and with the rest of the body to stay synchronized. We use the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as an experimental model, an invertebrate with activity and rest cycles similar to humans, which also deteriorate with aging.

## Research Topics

### Internal Clocks and Synchronization
- We investigate how brain clocks communicate to regulate metabolism, physiology, and behavior.
- We analyze the coordinated action of approximately 150 clock neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.
- We study the structural plasticity of clock neurons, observing how their projections change throughout the day.

### Plasticity and Neuronal Communication
- We explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the daily remodeling of clock neurons.
- We investigate how synaptic connectivity and neurotransmitter release vary throughout the day.
- We evaluate structural plasticity and its impact on the circadian network.

### Metabolic Integration and Biological Clock
- We study the relationship between basal cellular metabolism and the molecular clock.
- We explore how progressive dysfunction of these processes impacts lifespan.
- We investigate the interplay between lipid metabolism and the developmental program, and how these interactions are modulated by the biological clock.

## Approach

We combine genetic approaches and behavioral analyses with molecular tools, specific staining, and confocal microscopy to analyze the role of different molecules in the processes we are studying. We use genetic tools to interfere with gene expression or the function of specific groups of cells through genome editing and the expression of genetically encoded tools (such as RNA interference). We employ thermo- and chemogenetics coupled with calcium imaging as an indicator of neuronal activity, and evaluate the consequences of these manipulations at the molecular (transcriptomics), cellular and organ levels (imaging), and at the level of the intact animal (through behavioral assays).

## Advances

The long-term goal of the laboratory is to understand how behavior is controlled; we chose to study sleep and wake cycles, common to (almost) all animals, which depend on the activity of a discrete set of clock neurons. Over the years, we have analyzed how clock neurons communicate with each other; for example, we found that part of the connections between clock neurons remodel daily. This form of plasticity (which we call circadian structural plasticity) allows them to connect and disconnect even outside the network throughout the day! We also found that some clock neurons release more than one neurotransmitter (both excitatory and inhibitory types). All these observations suggest an unsuspected level of complexity in the circadian neuronal network, which could be essential for adapting to changing environmental conditions (for example, in preparation for daily or seasonal changes).
