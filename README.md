## About Us

At the Laboratory of Behavior Genetics, we are dedicated to understanding how the brain's internal clocks communicate with each other and with the rest of the body to stay synchronized. We use the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as an experimental model, an invertebrate with activity and rest cycles similar to humans, which also deteriorate with aging.

## Research Topics

### Internal Clocks and Synchronization
- We investigate how brain clocks communicate to regulate metabolism, physiology, and behavior.
- We analyze the coordinated action of approximately 150 clock neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.
- We study the structural plasticity of clock neurons, observing how their projections change throughout the day.

### Metabolic Integration and Biological Clock
- We study the relationship between basal cellular metabolism and the molecular clock.
- We explore how progressive dysfunction of these processes impacts lifespan.
- We investigate the interplay between lipid metabolism and the developmental program, and how these interactions are modulated by the biological clock.

## Approach

We use genetic and behavioral analyses with molecular tools, staining, and microscopy. Techniques include genome editing, RNA interference, thermo- and chemogenetics, calcium imaging, and transcriptomics to study molecular, cellular, and behavioral impacts.

## Advances

Our goal is to understand behavior control, focusing on sleep and wake cycles in clock neurons. We discovered daily remodeling, multi-neurotransmitter release, and complex circadian network adaptations for environmental changes.aily or seasonal changes).
